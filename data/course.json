  "course_description": "This workshop provides an introduction to urban environmental design and explores the potential of information technology and the Internet to transform public education, city design, and community development in inner-city neighborhoods. Integration of comprehensive (\"top-down\") and grassroots (\"bottom-up\") approaches to design and planning is a major theme.\n\nStudents will work in a real neighborhood with real people on a real project, putting theory into practice and reflecting on insights gained in the process. We will study environmental and community history and devise designs for vacant land near a middle school in West Philadelphia within the context of planning for the larger community and watershed.\n\nThe class website can be found here:\u00a0[Power of Place: Media Technology, Youth, and City Design and Development](http://architecture.mit.edu/class/place/).\n",
